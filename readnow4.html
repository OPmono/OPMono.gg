              <h1>Ridu Renovation Talk Vol 1</h1>
              <p>Hi Proxies,</p>
              <p>As a creative team eager to showcase our unique style and content to every player, we’re constantly thinking about how to shape the city of New Eridu and bring its daily life closer to everyone. Every time we see how the characters and stories resonate with you and how eagerly you are waiting for more new content, we truly feel that the city is becoming more real and alive.</p>
              <p>Since the official release of Zenless Zone Zero, many enthusiastic Proxies have been attracted to New Eridu to visit and explore. We would like to thank each and every Proxy for their interest and support!</p>  
              <p>Throughout this journey, we have also realized that many areas in the game need further refinement and optimization. We have received invaluable feedback from you, such as improving the connection between the HDD TV mode and combat experience, offering more diverse and challenging combat options, and optimizing some repetitive exploration experiences.</p>
              <p>In the first issue of the “Ridu Renovation Talk,” we’d love to discuss some of the main issues raised in your feedback and share our current plans for optimizing the game and future updates.</p>
              <h1>Optimizations expected to be implemented in Version 1.1</h1>
              <p>In terms of the narrative experience, in the latest story missions of Version 1.1, for the first time, you will be able to interact with New Eridu’s neighborhoods and fight through levels to advance the story’s progress from the perspective of the mission’s protagonist.</p>
              <p>A button for “Manual Chain Attack” mode will be added to the squad lineup interface before entering combat. In this mode, after Stunning an enemy, your actions will not trigger other Agents’ Chain Attacks. Additionally, a “Cancel Chain Attack Combo” function will be added to combat, allowing you to choose whether to use the “Manual Chain Attack” mode according to your preferences.</p>
              <p>In terms of combat, we have added a series of challenging combat missions and game modes that will be continuously updated. All Proxies are welcome to try them out in the new version.</p>
              <p>In Shiyu Defense, we have improved the display of enemies’ attribute resistances, making it easier for you to select suitable Agents for each challenge.</p>
              <p>After unlocking a new Agent, the Inter-Knot avatar of that Agent will be automatically unlocked. Now you can select your favorite Agent as your Inter-Knot avatar.</p>
              <p>The battle menu interface on mobile devices will allow you to customize certain UI buttons within a preset plan, so you can choose the controls that best suit your playstyle.</p>
              <h1>Optimizations expected to be implemented in Version 1.2</h1>
              <p>For completed Story Commissions and Exploration Commissions with uncollected rewards, we will be adding a “Fairy Assistance” feature (temporary name). Once you meet certain requirements, you can hand over these missions to Fairy and receive all the uncollected commission rewards after a set period of time.</p>
              <p>While exploring the “Monitor Array” the automatic accelerated playback, when enabled, will not be interrupted by other events. Additionally, the animation playback speed for some events will be increased, providing a smoother gaming experience.</p>
              <p>A “Preset Lineup” feature will be added. You will also be able to choose whether to include Bangboo in your lineup for battle commissions. The lineup controls before the “Shiyu Defense” will also be optimized.</p>
              <p>The entrance location for Agent Training will be adjusted, and repeated combat stages will be added, making it easier to access training and familiarize yourself with Agent-specific controls.</p>
              <p>After reaching a certain Inter-Knot level, a feature that allows you to freely change the time will be unlocked, making it more convenient to adjust the in-game time.</p>
              <p>Based on your feedback, we have optimized the background brightness in some commissions.</p>
              <h1>Optimizations expected to be implemented in later versions</h1>
              <p>Currently, you can only control Wise or Belle in the city instead of other Agents you have obtained. In the Special Program Livestreams of later versions, we will announce our current progress and future plans. Please stay tuned!</p>
              <p>We will be continuously improving the models for some Agents to provide Proxies with an improved visual experience.</p>
              <p>We will continuously optimize the interface interaction experience and combat interface UI. All Proxies are welcome to explore the game further and let us know your suggestions.</p>
              <p>The above is just part of our optimization plans. We will continue to pay attention to your gaming experience and further refine the game. We will keep adding more fun and challenging combat elements and adjusting the balance of the different game modes.</p>
              <p>We are aware that there is still much room for our team to grow and develop. Together with you, we hope to build New Eridu into the city of your dreams. Please continue to share your thoughts with us through our official feedback channels!</p>
